### Statement

Each of the modules is designed to address three main points:

+ Understand the idea of ​​each algorithm
+ Implement the algorithm in Python
+ Implement the algorithm in R

If you have any questions you can write to me privately at _lozas2605@gmail.com_, in the header of the email, state the topic.

Sincerely,
